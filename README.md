# The Binary Tree Data Structure
## Implementation of the Binary Tree Data Structure

### 0-binary_tree_node.c
A function that creates a binary tree node
* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
* And value is the value to put in the new node
* When created, a node does not have any child
* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

### 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c
A function that inserts a value as the left-child of another node
* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
* And value is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
* If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.
